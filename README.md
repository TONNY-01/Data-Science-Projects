# Data Science Projects Repository

Welcome to my Data Science Projects repository. This collection of Jupyter notebooks demonstrates various machine learning and data analysis projects. While the code in these notebooks is unstructured—reflecting an exploratory and iterative approach—it captures my journey in tackling real-world challenges across diverse domains. The projects are organized by ideas rather than polished production code, giving you a peek into the thought process behind each solution.

## Projects Overview

This repository includes notebooks covering several domain-specific challenges:

1. **Insurance Fraud Detection**  
   An exploratory project focused on detecting fraudulent insurance claims. This notebook covers data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and preliminary model experiments to identify suspicious claims.

2. **Fake News Detection**  
   A project in natural language processing that investigates how to distinguish authentic news from fake news. The notebook includes text cleaning, feature extraction, sentiment analysis, and classifier training.

3. **Malicious URL Detection**  
   This project targets the detection of malicious URLs. It involves data gathering, feature engineering, and the use of classification models to differentiate between safe and potentially dangerous URLs.

4. **Scraping Premier League Data**  
   A demonstration of web scraping techniques applied to collect and analyze data from the Premier League. The notebook details how to scrape websites, clean the collected data, and perform exploratory analysis on football statistics.

5. **Prediction of Premier League Performance**  
   Using historical data, this notebook applies machine learning to forecast team performance in the Premier League. It covers data wrangling, model building, evaluation metrics, and predictive analytics.

6. **Others**  
   Additional notebooks in this repository cover various other topics and experiments in data science. Each project is a standalone demonstration of exploratory data analysis and machine learning practices.
